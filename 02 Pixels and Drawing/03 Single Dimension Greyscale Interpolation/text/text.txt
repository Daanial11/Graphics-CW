Interpolating numbers is fine, but this unit is supposed to be about graphics - so let's draw something ! Using your floating point interpolation function that you wrote in the previous task, draw a greyscale gradient across the _DisplayWindow_, from left to right (as shown in the image below). 

You will need to create a range of RGB values packed into `uint32_t` variables in order to set the colour of each pixel. In order to achieve this, you will need to take a look at the slides and audio narration for this section (the blue buttons above) to find out more about pixels and pixel colour packing.

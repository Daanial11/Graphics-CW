In the earlier grayscale interpolation task, we were interpolating a single float value in just one dimension (the x axis). In this current task we will interpolate 3 float values (Red / Green / Blue) in two dimensions (x and y). Watch the animation button above to view a video showing more details about interpolating RGB colour values. Once you are confident with the concepts covered, implement the 2D RGB interpolation in order to produce the effect shown in the image below:
